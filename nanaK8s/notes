deploy webapp that connects to mongodb with external config data (with configmap and secret)
then make app accessible in browser

create the manifets by going to k8s documentation
search for service, deployment, configmap, secret

in the webapp we need the image which is from nana docker repo
create service in webapp yaml as well, use type nodeport to open service externally
reference user pwd and db url ref -- as env vars!
for external service we need to enable nodeport, and it has a specific range of port values

in mongo yaml
get mongo image frmo dockerhub
ref user and pwd as env as well, make sure port is correct

in mongo secret pass in the user and pw in base64 already
create configmap also

create configmap and secret first, because they are referenced by the other manifests

kct get all
kct logs <pod name>
to access the cluster we use minikube
minikube ip  #can also be kct get node -o wide
kct get events #my mongo is crashing non-stop
